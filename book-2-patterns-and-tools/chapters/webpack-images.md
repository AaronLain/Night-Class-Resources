# Including Images with Webpack
If you have a folder of local images that you want to load into your code things get a little strange with webpack.  Remember the only way webpack knows about assets is if they are imported into your javascript files.  Even our CSS is not added until those files are imported into our javascript files.  Below is some sample code for how to load a local image file into your project

```js
import cat from './assets/cat.jpg';

let domString = `<img src=${cat} alt="picture of a cat"/>`;

document.getElementById('cat').innerHTMl = domString;
```
