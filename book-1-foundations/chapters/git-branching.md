# Git Branching

## The Problem
Up to this point we have been following a simple git workflow:
* Make changes
* Add, commit, and push to master
* Start over

For the most part this works ok until we have more than one person using the same repo.  Let work through the following scenario.  Two teams are working on the same product at a well known tech company.  Lets call this company BookFace.

Team 1 is run by Anne.  Their job is to implement a new feature where people can react to comments.  It should look something like:

![reactions](../images/reactions.png)

Team 2 is run by Buster.  Busters team is building a feature where users can search for upcoming events.  It should look like this:

![find events](../images/find_events.png)

On top of creating these new feature the BookFace need to function without interruption.  Users should never know that something is changing until the features are completed - they shouldn't see partial new features.

Our current git workflow will not work for this.  If Anne and Buster are both making changes and commiting code to master then master will be polluted with code in various stages of done-ness.  The other option is for Anne and Buster to NEVER commit code until their feature is completely done - this is VERY risky and not a good option.


## The Solution
The simple solution to this problem is to use branches!  Basically each new feature gets its own branch.  Each branch is made off of the master branch at a certain point.  The history for the branch then diverges from master and the developers can do whatever they want/need to on the branch.  If things go horribly wrong they can delete the branch they made and none of the changes will make it to master.  When they are satisfied with the changes they have made to their branch and have sufficiently tested it out they can merge that code into master and the few feature will get delivered to the users in a completed form.

This new strategy looks something like this:

## Our Branching Process
__Step 1:__ Repo Creation
To start our process we will create a new repository in the exact same way we did before.
* We will make a local folder.
* Inside that folder we will make a README.md file.
* Inside the README.md file we will add a single line with the name of the project.
* We will create a repo on github
* We will connect the github repo to the local folder with `git remote add origin ...`
* We will add, commit, and push the changes to our README file to the master branch
* This will make our github master and our local master branch look the same

__Step 2:__ Create a branch

* Create a new branch on your machine:
```
git checkout -b za-newBranch
```
* Typically each company has a branch naming convention that they stick to.  In some places its the ticket number.  Here we will do initials-featurename
* you can check what branch you are on by typing `git branch`.  Your current branch will have an * next to it.  Confirm that you are on the branch you created.

__Step 3:__ write a bunch of code
* write some code
* `git add` it
* `git commit` it
![step3](../images/step3.png)

__Step 4:__ Push your branch to github
* when you are satisfied with your work push it to github
* `git push origin za-newBranch`
![step4](../images/step4.png)

__Step 5:__ Open a PR
* open a pull request - there are two ways to do that:
  * clicking on branches on your repo, finding the branch you want to PR and click the New Pull Request button
  * find a branch you just pushed to on the main page of your repo and click the Compare & Pull Request button
![step6](../images/step6.png)

* Select master for the base branch
* Select your branch name for the compare branch
* write a comment that explains what you changed and how to test this feature
* Click the Create Pull Request button
![step7](../images/step7.png)
![step5](../images/step5.png)





__Step 6:__ Review PR and merge it into master
* Test the code
* Look at the file diff in the PR and see if the code looks clean
* Make any changes needed
* Get an approval - use thumbs up symbol
* Click the Merge Pull Request button
![step9](../images/step9.png)
![step8](../images/step8.png)

__Step 7:__ Pull down master branch
* Once the PR has been merged to master we need to get those changes on our local
* Switch to the master branch: `git checkout master`
* Pull down the changes: `git pull origin master`

## Mini Challenge
Create a site for your favorite dinosaur.  Write clean code - consistent spacing, appropriate tabbing, etc. Use git, git branches, and github.  You should have a fresh branch for each of the following features:

* As a user, when I go to your site I should see your favorite color set to the background, and I should see a footer with your name and date.
* As a user, when I go to your site I should see a card with a picture of you and a paragraph about you, and this card should take up half the width of the screen

* As a user, when I go to your site I should see a card with a picture of your favorite type of dinosaur and a paragraph of why its your favorite dinosaur, and this card should take up half the width of the screen
