# Markdown

Markdown is a light-weight text formatting syntax.  It was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz.  It was written to be extremely readable and to be easily converted to html.  Because of this you can wright straight HTML in a markdown file and it will look like you expect it to.  Markdown has different "flavors".  You will mostly be using the github flavor since we will be using markdown to write README.md files that display on github.

If you want to look at the markdown documentation written by its makers you can do so [HERE](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

## Syntax
DON'T memorize the markdown syntax.  Go look it up if you don't remember it.  here are some great cheat sheets:
* [Adam P Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Markdown for Github](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## README.md
Every github project you have should have a well done README.md file.  This does a bunch of things for you:
* Shows employers you think creating documentation is important (they will want you to do this on the job)
* Shows employers you can articulate what you have done (soft skill)
* Shows people who find to your project how to use/run it
* Reminds you in 6+ months what the project is and how to use it


At minimum your readme file should have:
* Title (this is created on creation of the repo)
* Description
* Screenshot(s)
* Instructions for how to run the project
