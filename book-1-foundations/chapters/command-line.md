# Command Line Basics

## Introduction
The command line is a text based interface that allows you to control your computer.  You can use it to navigate your machines file structure and perform commands that you can't using just your computers file explorer.

## Tools
* __Mac Users__:  You will be using an application called [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac).  If you want another option that has some slightly flashier looking display take a look at [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* __Windows Users__:  You will be using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line) for 99.9% of the things we need.  We will let you know when specific commands require you to use something else.

## Why you need to know it
* __Control:__ Edit permissions, see hidden files, execute powerful commands (example:  running a project as an administrator)
* __Package Control:__ Install and interact with applications that have no other user interface (example: installing http-server)
* __Tasks Runners:__ Various processors that will aid in development (example: grunt, gulp, broccoli, or webpack)
* __Server control:__ Create scripts that control other machines (example: writing a script that deploys your code or getting logs from another server)

You will be using the command line EVERY day in this class.

## Class File Structure
For the next six months we will be working through three different milestones.  In order to make that go smoothly lets create a file structure so we are all coding in the same place.  Use the command line commands you just learned to create the following file structure:
![workspace file structure](../images/workspace_file_structure.png)

## Mini Challenge
Move the directory `html-css-101` you created in your HTML and CSS lesson and all of its contents from the `Desktop` into the directory `~/workspace/foundations/inclass`
