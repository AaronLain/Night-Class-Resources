# React Lifecycle Methods

Should be able to take pieces of [this](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) DOC and highlight important stuff

## componentDidMount
- Triggers right after your component has been put into the DOM.
- [componentDidMount React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount)

## componentWillUnmount
- Triggers right before a component is removed from the DOM. This method is a good place to put cleanup methods.
